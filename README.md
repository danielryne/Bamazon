# Bamazon

This simple CLI application creates a market of good for purchase by a user. This app will take in orders from the customer and deplete stock from the store's inventory accordingly. Information about the inventory is stored in a local SQL database. 

MySQL and Inquirer npm packages are required to run this app. 

This app was created using Javascript, Node, NPM, and SQL.
